Dependency Injection:
Process of constructing and assigning objects without explicitly writing code. (?)
For example @Autowire on objects with @Component annotation.

@Autowire:
Constructs and assign an object as soon as it's needed. Object requires @Component annotation.

@Bean:
???

@ComponentScan:
Scans for controllers and other things. Things annotated with @Component?

@PathVariable:
Acts as placeholders that can be used in method parameters.
Ex:
    @RequestMapping("/recipe/{name}")
    public String recipeDetails(@PathVariable String name, ...)

@Repository:
???

@RequestMapping:
Maps a certain URI request to a Java method.

@ResponseBody:
Use returned value as plain text instead of a html template.

@SuppressWarnings:
???
